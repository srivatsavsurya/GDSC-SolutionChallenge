LIFE-LEFT
(Leftovers to Lifelines)
An Innovative Food Redistribution System


To distribute the excess food available to the deprived people in an effective
and sufficient manner by forming a network which connects both the donor and
beneficent in a single platform.

Advantages:
• Our approch of the problem will act as the bridge between contributor and
recipient.
• This approach saves time and it is contactless. The only work of the users is
to provide the valid information.
• Active participation of people will help to reduce the hunger related problem
in our society thus moving towards zero hunger.
Disadvantages:
• If the user enters invalid data then entire process is collapsed as this entire
process depends on the user’s data.
